It is closely related to the North American wood duck, the only other member of the genus Aix. Aix is an Ancient Greek word used by Aristotle to refer to an unknown diving bird, and galericulata is the Latin for a wig, derived from galerum, a cap or bonnet. Mandarins feed by dabbling or walking on land. They mainly eat plants and seeds, especially beech mast.",
